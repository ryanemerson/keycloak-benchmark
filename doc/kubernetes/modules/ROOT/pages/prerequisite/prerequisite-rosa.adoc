= Installing OpenShift on AWS
:description: Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides an OpenShift instance to run Keycloak.

{description}

== About

This module is intended to automate tasks around provisioning OpenShift clusters in AWS via ROSA tool, as described in the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/getstarted[ROSA installation guide].
The scripts are located in the folder `provision/aws` in this repository.

== Prerequisites

. xref:prerequisite/prerequisite-awscli.adoc[]
. [Install OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)
. Perform the steps outlined in the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/getstarted[ROSA installation guide]:
.. Enable ROSA Service in AWS account
.. Download and install the ROSA command line tool
.. Create the service linked role for the Elastic Load Balancer
.. Log in to the ROSA CLI with your Red Hat account token and create AWS account roles and policies
.. Verify your credentials and quota

== Installation

The installation process is automated in the `rosa_create_cluster.sh` script in the folder `provision/aws` which takes its parameters from environment variables.

It loads environment variables pre-set in `.env` file inside the `aws/` directory.

The script creates the OpenShift cluster via `rosa create cluster` command, additionally it creates the required operator roles and OIDC provider.
After the installation process is finished, it creates a new admin user.

.Example `.env` file
----
CLUSTER_NAME=rosa-kcb
VERSION=4.13.8
REGION=eu-central-1
COMPUTE_MACHINE_TYPE=m5.xlarge
MULTI_AZ=false
REPLICAS=3
----

If no `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is provided in the configuration, it reads it from the AWS Secrets Manager.

=== Mandatory parameters

`VERSION`:: OpenShift cluster version.
`REGION`:: AWS region where the cluster should run.
`COMPUTE_MACHINE_TYPE`:: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[AWS instance type] for the default OpenShift worker machine pool.
`REPLICAS`:: Number of worker nodes.
If multi-AZ installation is selected, then this needs to be a multiple of the number of AZs available in the region.
For example, if the region has 3 AZs, then replicas need to be set to some multiple of 3.
+
Use the following command to find out about the AZs in the region:
+
[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region _region-name_
----

=== Optional parameters

`CLUSTER_NAME`:: Name of the cluster.
If not set, the value of the `$(whoami)` command will be used.
`ADMIN_PASSWORD`:: Password for the `cluster-admin` user.
If not set, it is obtained from AWS Secrets Manager secret equal to `KEYCLOAK_MASTER_PASSWORD_SECRET_NAME` parameter.
`KEYCLOAK_MASTER_PASSWORD_SECRET_NAME`:: Name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret containing the password for the `cluster-admin` user.
Defaults to `keycloak-master-password`.

== Finding URLs

To find out about existing clusters and their URLs, use the following commands:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
rosa list clusters
rosa describe cluster -c _cluster-name_
----

== Re-create admin user

The above installation script creates an admin user automatically but in case the user needs to be re-created it can be done via the `rosa_recreate_admin.sh` script, providing the `CLUSTER_NAME` and optionally `ADMIN_PASSWORD` parameter.

== Scaling the cluster's nodes on demand

The standard setup of nodes might be too small for running a load test, at the same time using a different instance type and rebuilding the cluster takes a lot of time (about 45 minutes).
To scale the cluster on demand, the standard setup has a machine pool named `scaling` with instances of type `m5.4xlarge` which is auto-scaled based on the current demand from 0 to 10 instances.
However, auto-scaling of worker nodes is quite time-consuming as nodes are scaled one by one.

To scale the machine pool faster, issue a command like the following, and the additional nodes will be spawned at the same time:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
rosa edit machinepool -c _**clustername**_ --min-replicas 3 scaling
----

To allow scaling the machine pool back to 0, use a command like the following:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
rosa edit machinepool -c _**clustername**_ --min-replicas 0 scaling
----

To use different instance types, use `rosa create machinepool` to create additional machine pools

== Rotate admin user password

The admin user password can be rotated via the `rosa_rotate_admin_password.sh` script.
Note the admin password for existing clusters is not updated.
The new password can be applied using script `rosa_recreate_admin.sh` with corresponding `CLUSTER_NAME` variable.

== Uninstallation

The uninstallation is handled by the `rosa_delete_cluster.sh` script.

The only required parameter is `CLUSTER_NAME`.

Additionally, it deletes the cluster's operator roles and OIDC provider, and the admin user.
